			<h1>Is It for You</h1>
			<p><span id="firstLetter">A</span>ustralians have the right to contribute to the society in which they live. Volunteers enhance the quality of services being provided by community-based non-profit organizations. Volunteers are people who help provide a service that benefits the wider community. They do this of their own free-will and without financial payment. The distinction between voluntary work and other types of work can appear hazy to some people. Some volunteering is structured; that is, it is administered through an organization or association. Volunteering can also be informal, such as driving a neighbor to a medical appointment or fundraising by selling raffle tickets. The most popular areas of volunteer work are by contributing to: sporting, education, religion, health and welfare, community service, recreational, emergency services, arts, environmental as well as heritage organizations.</p>
			<p>National Standards have been developed by Volunteering Australia to ensure that all organisations using volunteers maintain a best practice standard, and that volunteers are not exploited. National Standards are in place to help protect and develop the industry and the workers within the voluntary industry. Volunteer management or coordination is now regarded as a legitimate and worthwhile career choice. As volunteers make up the major portion of the not-for-profit sector work force which is a sector of the economy worth nearly $45 billion or 10% of gross domestic product. Thus, the need for standards to protect volunteers rights has become increasingly important.</p>
