			<h1>What is Volunteer</h1>
			<p><span id="firstLetter">V</span>olunteering is a fundamental building block of a civil society. It brings to life the noblest aspirations of human-kind the pursuit of peace, freedom, opportunity, safety, and justice for all people. In this fast paced era of globalization and continuous change, the World is becoming smaller, more interdependent, and more complex. Volunteering either through individual or group action is a way in which human values of community, caring, and serving can be sustained and strengthened. Individuals can exercise their rights and responsibilities as members of communities, while continuing to learn and grow throughout their lives, realising their full potential. </p>
			<p>Connections can be made across differences that push us apart so that we can live together in healthy, sustainable communities, working together to provide innovative solutions to our shared challenges and to shape our collective destinies.At the dawn of the new millennium, volunteering is an essential element of all societies. It turns into practical, effective action the declaration of the United Nations that We, the Peoples have the power to change the world.</p>
			<p>Volunteer work is never for payment. However, out-of-pocket expenses, such as travel costs, may be reimbursed. Once the volunteer position becomes a paid position, the work ceases to be voluntary. Some people are sometimes paid for a certain amount of hours a week to run a program for a not-for-profit organisation while still contributing volunteer hours. At times, volunteer work can directly lead to paid employment. This should never be the sole motivation for volunteering though. Volunteering is also an invaluable pathway for gaining experience, improving and learning new skills, which will assist people in obtaining paid employment. It builds on skills and confidence and thereby motivates many volunteers to pursue further training and/or to apply for paid positions.</p>
