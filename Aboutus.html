			<h1>Culture of the Organisation</h1>
			<p><span id="firstLetter">T</span>he importance of the organisational culture is to treat volunteers fairly and equally. Additionally when a person is volunteering, the attitudes of people in key positions towards encouraging volunteer involvement in the organisation should never be under-rated. Traditionally, people who volunteer care about their fellow humans, they see value in a fair and just society for everybody, and up-hold the Australian way of life to role up the sleeves and pitch in as active participants to ensure their communities prosper and grow. Wide Bay Volunteers aims towards encouraging a supportive environment that recognises individual needs, skills and experiences of volunteers. In doing so, we endeavour to encourage and support through inclusion and involvement to find potential volunteer.</p>
			<h1>Our Goals</h1>
			<p>Our service is targeted to those who are sixty and older who have little contact with their families, or whose families are unable to visit. We connect volunteers with aged care residential facilities to provide the love & support a family would provide.  Our volunteers visit with residents to provide them with much needed companionship.</p>
			<p>Volunteering is a fundamental building block of a civil society. It brings to life the noblest aspirations of human-kind, that isthe pursuit of peace, freedom, opportunity, safety, and justice for all people.In this fast paced era of globalization and continuous change, the World is becoming smaller, more interdependent, and more complex. Volunteering, either through individual or group action. It is a way in which:Human values of community, caring, and serving can be sustained and strengthened. Individuals can exercise their rights and responsibilities as members of communities, while continuing to learn and grow throughout their lives, realising their full potential. </p>
			<p>Connections can be made across differences that push us apart so that we can live together in healthy, sustainable communities, working together to provide innovative solutions to our shared challenges and to shape our collective destinies.At the dawn of the new millennium, volunteering is an essential element of all societies. It turns into practical, effective action the declaration of the United Nations that We, people, shave the power to change the world.</p>
